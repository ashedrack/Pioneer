# Security and Authentication

## Overview
Each agent is configured with an API key, ensuring only authorized agents send data to the CloudPioneer platform.

## Data Encryption
All data is encrypted in transit (via TLS) and at rest in Datadog's backend.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Access to data is controlled via user and team roles in the Datadog interface.
